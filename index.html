      <h2>What is the 2020 Census, and why is it important?</h2>
      <p>
        The 2020 Census counts every person living in the United States. The
        count is mandated by the Constitution and conducted by the U.S. Census
        Bureau. It provides <strong>critical data</strong> that lawmakers,
        business owners, teachers, and many others use it to provide daily
        services, products, and support for you and your community.

      <p>
        In NYC, a full count for 2020 Census is especially important as many
        neighborhoods are historically undercounted. In 2010, the self-response
        rate in New York was 62%, while the national average was 76%. In some
        neighborhoods, self-response rates were as low as 35%. This leads to
        less funding for public edudction, housing, senior centers,
        infrastructure, and much more.
